# Conclusion
In conclusion, the evaluation of the classification models reveals promising outcomes. The U-Net model achieved exceptional performance with a loss of 0.1486 and an accuracy of 94.33%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying breast cancer features. On the other hand, the ResNet-50 model exhibited moderate results, achieving a loss of 0.6916 and an accuracy of 72.70%. Further analysis and fine-tuning could potentially enhance the performance of both models for more accurate breast cancer classification.
